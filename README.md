- **/gwas_sex**: GWAS of sex, sex heritability accross studies and genetic correlation between traits in 23andMe and UKBB, as described in the main text - *Figure 1, 2, 4*

- **/pleiotropy**: pleiotropy analysis of the sex-associated loci, see *Supplementary Notes* and *Supplementary Table 5* 

- **/census**: differences in EA level between UKBB participants and census data - *Figure 5B*

- **/simulations**: simulations to illustrate effects of sex-differential participation bias and implementation of proposed correction methods in genomicSEM - *Supplementary Notes/Figures 3, 4, 6, 8*

- **/sex_specific_MR**: simulations on real UKBB data to demonstrate the potential extent of selection biased by BMI on the causal effect of BMI on T2D - *Supplementary Notes/Figure 5*
